                  Conditions represent the current state of the Component resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Ready": the component is fully functional
                  - "Progressing": the component is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the component failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.

                  This field serves dual purpose:
                  - Provider state tracking: Controllers persist reconciliation state across loops
                  - Component outputs: Data exposed for dependent components via templates

                  Template authors reference this to access observed provider state:
                    {{`{{ .database.providerStatus.endpoint }}`}}

                  The provider (component handler) has full control over this field's content.
                  This field is opaque to the orchestration layer.
