# Tier 1: Critical Production Blockers

These features are typically blockers for enterprise adoption and should be implemented first. Without these capabilities, organizations cannot deploy the Helm handler in production environments.

## Authentication & Security

### Private Helm Repositories

Support for authenticated access to private chart repositories.

**Business Justification:**

Most enterprise Helm charts are stored in private repositories requiring authentication. Public repositories are insufficient for proprietary applications and internal services.

**Requirements:**

- Basic auth, bearer token, TLS client certificate support
- Secret-based credential management per Component
- Integration with existing `HelmRepository` configuration
- Support for multiple authentication methods per repository

**Security Impact:**

Critical for compliance - without proper authentication, enterprises cannot use private chart repositories, blocking adoption entirely.

**Architecture Considerations:**

- Authentication credentials must be stored as Kubernetes secrets
- Component reconciler needs RBAC permissions to read authentication secrets
- Authentication failures should be clearly reported in Component status
- Support for credential rotation without Component updates

### External Secret Management

Integration with enterprise secret stores to eliminate plain-text secrets in Component configurations.

**Business Justification:**

Storing secrets in Component specifications violates enterprise security policies and compliance requirements.
Integration with existing secret management infrastructure is mandatory.

**Requirements:**

- HashiCorp Vault integration for secret injection
- AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault support
- Kubernetes External Secrets Operator compatibility
- Secret rotation and lifecycle management
- Template-based secret injection into Helm values

**Security Impact:**

Critical for compliance - secrets in Component specs are a major security risk that prevents enterprise adoption.

**Architecture Considerations:**

- Secret injection must happen at deployment time, not during Component creation
- Secrets should never be stored in Component status or logs
- Secret rotation must be handled transparently without manual intervention
- Failed secret retrieval should result in deployment failure with clear error messages

## Deployment Reliability

### Operation Timeouts

Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging operations and stuck reconciliation loops.

**Business Justification:**

Production environments require predictable deployment behavior. Hanging operations can block critical deployments and prevent automated recovery procedures.

**Requirements:**

- Deployment start timeout (default: 5m, configurable)
- Readiness check timeout (default: 10m, configurable)
- Cleanup operation timeout (default: 5m, configurable)
- Component-level and global timeout configuration
- Grace period for cleanup operations

**Operational Impact:**

Without timeouts, failed deployments can hang indefinitely, requiring manual intervention and breaking automated deployment pipelines.

**Architecture Considerations:**

- Timeouts should be configurable at multiple levels (global, Component, operation)
- Timeout expiration should trigger proper cleanup and status updates
- Timeout values should be validated for reasonable ranges
- Different timeout values needed for different deployment sizes

### Rollback Capabilities

Ability to revert failed or problematic deployments.

**Business Justification:**

Production incidents require rapid recovery. Manual rollback procedures are too slow and error-prone for enterprise environments.

**Requirements:**

- Helm history management and `helm rollback` integration
- Component spec versioning and rollback triggers
- Automatic rollback on health check failures
- Manual rollback through Component state management
- Rollback to specific revision numbers

**Business Impact:**

Critical for production confidence and incident response. Without rollback, deployment failures become extended outages.

**Architecture Considerations:**

- Rollback operations must be atomic and reliable
- Component status should track rollback operations and results
- Rollback history should be preserved for audit purposes
- Integration with existing incident response procedures

### Dry Run Validation

Pre-deployment testing without applying changes.

**Business Justification:**

Change management processes require validation before production deployment. Dry run capabilities enable safe testing of configuration changes.

**Requirements:**

- Helm `--dry-run` flag integration for template validation
- Configuration validation before deployment
- Resource conflict detection and reporting
- Template rendering verification
- RBAC and resource quota validation

**Enterprise Value:**

Required for change management processes and risk reduction. Enables confidence in deployment changes before production application.

**Architecture Considerations:**

- Dry run operations should simulate full deployment without resource creation
- Validation results should be reported in Component status
- Dry run should catch configuration errors early in the pipeline
- Integration with CI/CD validation workflows

## Security Requirements

### Credential Management

All authentication and secret management must follow enterprise security standards:

- **Encryption at Rest:** All secrets encrypted in Kubernetes etcd
- **Encryption in Transit:** TLS for all external secret store communications
- **Access Control:** RBAC restrictions on secret access per namespace/tenant
- **Audit Logging:** All secret access operations must be logged

### Network Security

Private repository access introduces network security requirements:

- **Egress Control:** Configurable network policies for repository access
- **Proxy Support:** Integration with enterprise proxy servers
- **Certificate Validation:** Proper TLS certificate chain validation
- **DNS Security:** Secure DNS resolution for repository endpoints

## Operational Requirements

### Monitoring & Alerting

Critical features must be observable in production:

- **Authentication Failures:** Alerts on credential validation failures
- **Timeout Events:** Monitoring of deployment timeout occurrences
- **Rollback Operations:** Tracking of rollback frequency and success rates
- **Secret Rotation:** Alerts on secret rotation failures

### Performance Expectations

Tier 1 features should not significantly impact deployment performance:

- **Authentication Overhead:** < 2 seconds additional latency
- **Secret Retrieval:** < 5 seconds for external secret stores
- **Validation Time:** Dry run operations < 30 seconds for typical charts
- **Rollback Speed:** < 60 seconds for standard rollback operations

## Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Integration

Tier 1 features must integrate with enterprise CI/CD systems:

- **Pipeline Validation:** Dry run integration with GitLab/Jenkins/GitHub Actions
- **Secret Management:** Integration with CI/CD secret stores
- **Rollback Triggers:** Automated rollback on pipeline failure detection
- **Status Reporting:** Component status integration with deployment dashboards

### Compliance Integration

Features must support compliance and audit requirements:

- **Change Tracking:** All configuration changes must be attributable
- **Access Logging:** Authentication attempts and secret access logged
- **Rollback Auditing:** Complete audit trail of rollback operations
- **Validation Records:** Dry run results preserved for compliance review

This tier represents the minimum viable enterprise feature set. Without these capabilities, the Helm handler cannot meet basic production and security requirements for enterprise deployment.
