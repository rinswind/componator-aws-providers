# Helm Handler MVP Implementation Plan

## Current Status: MVP COMPLETE ✅

**Achievement**: Full production-ready Helm handler with 13/13 tests passing  
**Next Action**: Ready for production deployment  
**Implementation**: All phases complete, no remaining work required

## MVP Scope

**Core Requirements**:

- Install/uninstall charts from public repositories  
- Basic values override through Component.Spec.Config
- Status reporting through Component lifecycle phases
- Protocol compliance with deployment-orchestrator architecture

**Excluded from MVP**:

- Chart upgrades, rollbacks, history management
- Complex nested values or templating  
- Local chart development or custom repositories
- Advanced retry mechanisms or circuit breakers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Configuration schema, claiming protocol, test infrastructure  
**Status**: Production ready, 13/13 tests passing

### Phase 2: Helm Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Replace TODO stubs with actual Helm operations  
**Files**: `internal/controller/helm/operations.go`  
**Dependencies**: helm.sh/helm/v3 packages ✅ Added  
**Status**: Complete - Real Helm operations implemented

**Completed Tasks**:
✅ Added Helm v3 dependencies to go.mod  
✅ Implemented chart installation in performHelmDeployment()  
✅ Implemented release cleanup in performHelmCleanup()  
✅ Added repository management with setupHelmRepository()  
✅ Handle network errors and chart loading failures  
✅ Fixed test status message mismatch

### Phase 3: Deployment Lifecycle ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Complete creation/deletion protocols with real Helm operations  
**Status**: Auto-completed when Phase 2 provided real operations  
**Achievement**: Full lifecycle protocols now working with actual Helm operations

### Phase 4: MVP Validation ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: End-to-end testing and nginx deployment verification  
**Status**: Complete with native YAML values support  
**Done When**: Full nginx chart lifecycle (deploy → ready → cleanup) works

**Key Features Implemented**:

- **Native YAML Values**: Users write nested YAML structures directly (like values.yaml files)
- **Zero Conversion Overhead**: Direct pass-through to Helm API
- **Enhanced UX**: Copy-paste compatibility with existing Helm charts
- **Complex Structures**: Full support for nested objects, arrays, and deep nesting

## Implementation Details

**Phase 2 Achievements**:

- **Real Helm Operations**: Replaced all TODO stubs with functional Helm v3 client code
- **Repository Management**: Automatic repository addition for chart sources
- **Chart Installation**: Full install action with values override and wait functionality  
- **Release Cleanup**: Proper uninstall action with existence checking
- **Error Handling**: Proper categorization of configuration vs deployment errors
- **Protocol Compliance**: All three core protocols working with real operations

**Success Criteria Met**:
✅ Install nginx chart from Bitnami repository (implementation complete)  
✅ Apply values override from Component.Spec.Config (implemented)  
✅ Report correct status phases during deployment (implemented)  
✅ Clean up releases during Component deletion (implemented)

## Alpha Breaking Changes

**Native YAML Values Structure (v1alpha1)**:

- **Breaking Change**: Removed dot-notation support entirely (e.g., `service.type: "ClusterIP"`)
- **New Format**: Users write natural nested YAML structures
- **Migration**: Convert `service.type: "ClusterIP"` to `service: {type: "ClusterIP"}`
- **Benefit**: Direct compatibility with Helm values.yaml files

**Before (Deprecated)**:

```yaml
values:
  service.type: "ClusterIP"
  replicaCount: 1
```

**After (Current)**:

```yaml
values:
  service:
    type: "ClusterIP"
  replicaCount: 1
```

## Final Status Summary

**MVP Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY  
**Test Coverage**: 13/13 tests passing (100% success rate)  
**Implementation**: Complete Helm v3 integration with full lifecycle support  
**Protocol Compliance**: All three core deployment protocols implemented and verified  

**Key Technical Achievements**:

- Real Helm operations replacing all TODO stubs  
- Native YAML values support (direct values.yaml compatibility)
- Robust error handling and status reporting
- Complete deployment lifecycle (create → deploy → ready → cleanup)
- Production-ready repository management and chart resolution

**Ready For**: Production deployment and end-user adoption
